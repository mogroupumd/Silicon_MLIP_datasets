# Silicon_MLP_datasets
Training, validation, and testing datasets for the publication "The discrepancies, the extrapolability, and the interpolability of machine learning interatomic potentials on simulating atomic dynamics"

# Data architecture
Each directory contains:
1.  The compressed structural data (in VASP POSCAR format with .zip file)
2.  The corresponding energies, forces, distances to nearest migrating atoms, and distances to nearest vacancies data  (DATA.json)
3.  (Available only for testing datasets) the compressed structural data for vacancies (in VASP POSCAR format with .zip file)
